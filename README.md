# rpi_tf_and_opencv
Base code for using the Raspberry Pi, PiCam, OpenCV, and Tensorflow to capture and predict image content.

I've written an article to go with this repo: 

* [Install Tensorflow and OpenCV on Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://ladvien.com/setup-raspberry-pi-tensorflow/)

It's part of an instructional series on building a deep-learning LEGO sorting machine.
